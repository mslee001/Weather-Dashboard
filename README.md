This is a weather dashboard that will allow a user to search for a city and display the weather results.

The weather is displayed using the OpenWeatherMap API.

The user's search history is displayed in the left column. The current weather will be displayed at the top right section and the 5-day forecast will display below current.

The current weather data includes an icon, current temp, humidity, wind speed and UV index. The UV index will change color based on low-severe conditions.

The 5-day forecast includes the date, icon, daily temp, and humidity.

The last searched city will be saved in local storage. The next time the user opens the weather dashboard, their last searched city will display with current weather information.
